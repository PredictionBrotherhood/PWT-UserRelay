  - This multi-region setup will enhance performance and reduce latency by placing servers closer to user locations, with each instance managed via Coolify for consistent deployment and monitoring.
  
- **Monitoring and Optimization**:
  - As Predict View scales, additional performance monitoring and load balancing will be introduced to maintain seamless service across regions.
